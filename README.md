## My Amazing Job Board

### Origin

I created this job board web app at Railsbridge Oakland in November 2014. It was so much fun. 

### Usage

Just clone this repo and add whatever you want. (Formatting? A search function?) Remember to run rake db:migrate! 

### Contribution

Please feel free to send me a pull request! This was seriously just a couple-hours project to get started with. Needs some wheels and a motor to really get going.
